# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The Purpose of the analysis was to Visualization the outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals. Although we filtered out the catagories already, the information was still very unclear. I needed to go a step further, and create visualizations of the data. Many people can look at the chart, and see it as just a bunch of numbers. The purpose of the charts, is to make things clear, and understandable.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Analysis and Challenges. I had to use the hints in the Module page, because I was not at all familair to them. The videos inside helped give me a visual on what to do. I had several challenges that came with this worksheet. The first challenge was in the 'Theater Outcomes by Launch Date'. I could not figure out what filters went in what boxes. I had help from AskBCS Learning Assitant, and the problem was resolved. The other challenge, was using the CountIFs Function. I was missing a criteria, but in the end, I got it. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date. Here is what I got from it. Our peak Successful goal was reached in May with over 230 campaigns. After May, it did drop down to 147 successful campaigns. Then we had three consitent months of only 100 failed campaignes per month. The only times we peaked in cancled campaigns was in July and November. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals. This is what I got from it. We had 689 Successful campaignes, the majority when the goal was in the $5,000-$9,999 range. So that was on of the easiest ranges to meet. On the other hand, when the goal was $1,000-$4,999 more people failed to reach that goal. Around 245 of them failed at it. In the end, not many people canceled. Only about 25 campaigns did so.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Here are just a few limitations. First limitation, you need to understand a graph to see the information you want to see. Otherwise, it can be confusing with the spreadsheet. Second limitation, is how manual it is to organise. Learning hotkeys, and moving around Excel would be more efficient when working on projects.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Instead of just categorizing one specific subcategory, try all of them. Then, create graphs based on which ones of those were successful. It can also be possible to introduce a bargraph, and to utilize that to determine successful campaignes to failed campaignes. If the line graph was too unclear. I find the bargraph can be more visual.
